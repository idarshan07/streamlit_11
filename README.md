## Serve Neural Network Model Using Streamlit
#### In this mini project, a pretrained image classification model will be served on cloud using stremlit.

#### Reference - https://github.com/RanFeldesh/streamlit-examples/tree/main

#### Python code for the image classification app has been taken from aforementioned github repository of professor Ran but the structure of code is slightly different.

#### User can upload the image and model will classify it from available classes of ImageNet.
